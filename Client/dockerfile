# Step 1: Use an official Node.js image to build the app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the package.json and package-lock.json to leverage Docker cache
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (legacy-peer-deps for compatibility)
RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Copy the rest of the application's source code
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use a lightweight NGINX image to serve the built app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Remove the default NGINX static file configuration
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

# Copy the React build output to the NGINX static file directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 (default HTTP port)
EXPOSE 80

# Use the default NGINX configuration file to serve the app
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
