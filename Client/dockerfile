# Step 1: Use an official Node.js image to build the app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Copy the rest of the app's source code to the container
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use a lightweight web server to serve the build
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build folder from the build stage to the NGINX server folder
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 (default HTTP port)
EXPOSE 80

# Start NGINX to serve the React app
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
