# Emotional Solutions
## A Nokia Innovation Student Project

### Overview
This project focuses on developing a creative and interactive feedback system using facial emotion recognition technology. The system allows users to provide feedback in a non-verbal manner by capturing a picture and analyzing the emotions conveyed through facial expressions. The goal is to leverage AI-driven emotion analysis to improve user experience and interactions in various applications, including customer feedback, mental health support, and personalized content delivery.

### Tech Stack:
- **Python**: The core programming language for building the emotion recognition system.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and capturing facial expressions.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to serve the application and handle requests.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Docker Compose**: To manage multi-container Docker applications and simplify deployment.
- **Python Virtual Environment (venv)**: To create isolated environments for managing dependencies.
